O(n) - which is also known as linear time. 
Linear time means that the time taken to run the algorithm increases in direct proportion to the number of input items.


What is the difference between Big O and Big Omega notations?
The difference between Big O notation and Big Omega notation is that 
Big O is used to describe the worst case running time for an algorithm. 
But, Big Omega notation, on the other hand, is used to describe the best case running time for a given algorithm.
